        5) The Access Token will be generated and will be usable for 1 to 2 hours before a new token must be generated

    Group ID
        1) Go to the page of the group that is to be crawled
        2) The URL should be something like:
            https://www.facebook.com/groups/000000000000000/
        3) The ID is the number in the URL that is in place of the 0's

Using the Crawler:
    To use the Facebook Crawler you must enter an Access Token, a group ID, and a number to specify how many posts you want to crawl. This information can be provided using command line arguments using the form:

        FacebookCrawler.py [Access Token] [Group ID] [Number of Posts]

    The required information can also be provided as responses to queries in the program. If no command-line arguments are provided, the program will first ask for you to enter your Access Token, then the Group ID, then the number of posts to crawl.


**Note that there is no limit to the number of posts that can be crawled. However, If a large number is provided (i.e. 3000), the program can take a substantial amount of time to complete the crawl.
